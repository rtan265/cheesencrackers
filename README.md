# AUCS101
May19 cheese and crackers

My first ever Hackathon. Back in May 2018, I have no clue on what to do in a Hackathon, and this experience has definitely opened my eyes to using version control such as Git, and how to work collaboratively with others on a technical project. 

Code that was written here are really bad, and back then we decided to build each webpage from scratch (which I've now realized is really stupid). But we had a lot of fun, and had a great time learning from other teams and from the mentors!
